    <h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1>

    <p>Yeah, so I started my coding journey a few months back and it's being really fulfilling for me, I never knew I could spend long amount of hours glued to my system.</p>
    <p>Asides coding, I do go to the hospital once in a while, trying to keep the medical student in me alive.</p>
    <p>And at my leisure time, I love playing football, it gives me soooo much joy!</p>
